                                        <li>Clickthrough rate is much lower than Open rate indicating that , recipients did not perform any further action upon consciously or unconsciously opening the email. Email subject and Content should be improved and simplified for recipients.</li>

Transform the data as required and further must utilize Foursquare client /API to explore the various location data in the selected city to answer the Business query.Foursquare client API is a social location service that provides real time access to foursquare client global database. The database has rich information about venue and user ratings. </p>

                                     <p class="text-left" mb1 > <u><em>Introduction</em></u></p>
                                        
                                        <p class="text-justify" mb-1>Toronto is not only the financial hub and largest populated city of Canada; it is also one of cities which is vouched for real estate investments in the world. Toronto real-estate market rise around 20% every year. Many large builders and also mid-sized investors prefer to set up their real estate businesses in neighborhoods of Toronto.</p> 
                                        
                                        <p class="text-justify" mb-1>One of the most popular investment strategies for mid- size and small investors is to buy residential properties and rent out. In last few years Toronto real estate market has seen sharp uprise and is highly inflated. Investing on rental properties in such volatile market can be risky and tricky at the same time.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="text-justify" mb-1>The choice of neighborhood is critical as it can impact the demand and also timeline as in how quick the property is occupied. The Return on Investment depends on these two factors. It is observed that in some of the popular neighborhoods, buying homes prove economical than renting. With low mortgage interest rate and low-down payments, Residents prefer to pay Mortgage interests rather than paying rent and own the property after amortization period.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="text-justify" mb-1>In such scenario, the best bet would be on temporary residents like students, temporary workers or trainees. The probability of this group of people renting home is more than buying. Hence investing in residential rentals in the neighborhoods with large and popular academic institutions make sense.</p>
                                        
                                       <p class="text-left" mb1 > <u><em>Requirement</em></u></p> 
                                         
                                        <p class="text-justify" mb-1>Mr. A is a mid-size real estate investor and is looking to invest in residential properties to rent in Toronto. He is mainly looking into single family homes or Condo properties. From his experience he suggests that temporary tenants prefer economical condos or small houses in main city rather than extended outskirts with well-connected public transit. He thinks such tenants prefers comfortable and maintainable small spaces   in busy hub over big luxurious homes in nature rich outskirts. But at the same time, they would look for easy accessibility to places and nearness to their university or schools for their children. He wants us the Data scientists' team, to explore various neighborhoods of Toronto city and suggest which neighborhood is more suitable for his type of investment.  </p>

                                        <p class="text-justify" mb-1>The main concern of Mr. A is that, the properties that he would invest on should not be vacant for more than 3 months any time of the year. Also, he prefers tenants who don't live more than 3-4 years in a stretch in same property. He believes in carrying out maintenance changes himself every few years. With tenants living in property, it gets difficult for him. With this given criterion from Mr. A, we would target neighborhoods with universities and school districts. Most of the temporary tenants are either university/college students or single families who come to city for work purposes. Such population would prefer to live near their locations of interest and be well connected even without their own travel options. </p>

The join is per    formed on postal_code column as index..The dataset at this point has 10 Boroughs and 103 unique Neighborhoods. This dataset forms the basis for further data analysis </li>

                                            <li>We will run the Foursquare function to retrieve the list of different Venue category types. Also, we would define the Foursquare function to extract the nearby Venues for all of our neighborhood. In this function we will input our required categories and the radius to be 1km. This is done in request URL.</li>
                                            <li>Toronto coordinates are obtained and using the coordinates above function are run to obtain the nearby venues for each neighborhood.We obtain a total of 2154 venues for 103 neighborhoods. We have 87 unique categories in the result. All these 87 categories are sub categories of the major categories that we have included in our request.</li>

                                            <li>We have then created One Hot encoding on categories for each neighborhood in the above dataset. This is done to convert the categorical values i.e., venues to numerical (Boolean). This is necessity for applying any machine learning algorithms on the dataset as they can only perform analysis on numerical values. </li>
                                            <li>Further on the encoded dataset we calculate the mean function for each neighborhood. This gives us the frequency of occurrence of each Venue category out of total venue categories in each neighborhood. For example, a value of <STRONG>Day Care= 0.066667</STRONG> in Agincourt neighborhood indicates that the ratio of occurrence of Day care in proportion with other venue categories is 0.066667.</li>
                                            <li>At this step, we further cleaned our dataset to filter out unnecessary venue categories. The initial categories that we included has several sub categories. Out of those some categories are redundant and some don't need to be considered in our analysis. For example, <strong>‘College ground’</strong> category that is part of <strong>‘College and university’</strong> category can be removed. In our scenario we would consider the nearby college and we don't need to consider grounds.</li>
                                            <li>After the above transformation our dataset has only 17 venue categories for 103 neighborhoods' categories included are

                                        <li>Cluster 3 has all of the locations of interest to the business. All the neighborhoods are close to each other and can be accessed by residents in any of these neighborhoods. Rental properties in Cluster 3 would give better ROI</li>
                                        <li>Cluster 1 will be second choice.  It has good number of schools and colleges with good transit options. </li>

                                <p class="text-left" mb1><strong>Discussion</strong> </p>
                                        <p class="text-justify" mb-1>The neighborhoods considered for analysis are limited to Toronto city and includes no suburb information for simplicity of model. This data analysis is carried out solely based on the number of venue categories available from Foursquare. It is not prescribed to recommend the options just based on the calculation of neighborhood and venue dataset.</p>
                                        <p class="text-justify" mb-1>Data analysis could be significantly improved by considering the average home prices, Expected rent and options like crime rate in that location. Since I could not get the public data on this information, I based my analysis on the available relevant data.</p>
                                        <p class="text-justify" mb-1>k-means algorithm is most suitable algorithm for clustering in such categorical dataset. However, we did get few outliers even with the best value of k. This could not be avoided in unsupervised model of algorithm. Clusters is not perfectly disjoint in this case as all the records of data belong to similar Venue categories in our requirement. So labelling data is difficult and consists of ambiguity. </p>
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                <p class="text-left" mb1><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>  
                                      <p class="text-justify" mb-1>Toronto is no doubt a hot market for investing in real estate properties. But as discussed earlier, the neighborhood data should be carefully studied to ensure better Return of Investment. The volatile financial market and fluctuating Bank interest rates just add to the problem. But if invested in right neighborhood for right type of tenant, Business could make huge passive income with significant profits. </p>

                                        <li>5. Considering  the consistency in both Seasonal and Playoff games  and also metric numbers which are slightly higher , I choose Lebron as G.O.A.T for given dataset.</li>
                        
                                    </ul>         
                                        
                                        <p class="mb-1"><strong><u>Assumptions</u></strong></p>
                                        <p>It was a very close call, metric numbers are very near. Hence the comparison cannot be concluded as one sided.   Also, an assumption is being made here that both greats are from same era  and have same sport facilities. We have to agree that in recent times sports analytics  have grown multiple times. Sports forms critical component of  entertainment economy . Hence lots of investments being made to provide addition assistance to sportsmen to perform better . Jordan would have not got these aids as compared to Lebron. Hence , we can declare both as G.O.A.T of their times.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="text-justify mb=1">For me, Jordon is beyond just  a Sports champion. He is a role model who inspires.</p>

                                        After cleaning the raw data and analysing, I realized the dashboard could be created to cater different audiences Travelers, Hosts or airbnb itself. Because the challenge talked about vacation, I deceided to create a explanotary dashboard for general travelers who would be prospective airbnb future guests. I used Power BI for mining as well as Visualizations.

                                    <p>We had airbnb data spanning from 2008 to 2021 for the 10 most popular travel destinations in the world. We had informations related to airbnb property listings as well as review data from past guests.Some of the major insights from my analysis includes : </p>
                                    <ol>
                                    <li>Paris is most preferred vacation destination amongst 9 other destinations. Around ~100k travellers traveled to Paris each year. Rome and Newyork are next preferred destinations.</li>
                                    <li>With popularity of airbnb itself , the number of hosts and travelers residing in airbnb hosted properties have both increased multiple folds. The price is economical with an avg of around ~45$ USD.</li> 
                                    <li>Average Price vary majorly based on the city (Currency and economy plays the role!) followed by type of property , Host past ratings and 'Super Host' label. Super Host label is directly proportional to the Ratings that Host has obatained.</li>
                                    <li>All the listed destinations offer different experiences like nature /architecture / city life etc. Hence The major difference in market is the season they are visited. Rome, Mexico City and Hong Kong is observed to have pretty consistent travels throughout the year irrespective of seasons.</li>
                                    <li>Most preferred airbnb accommodation seems to be an entire apartment for rent.</li>
                                    <li>Rome and Mexico city offers better value in terms of the prices, better average ratings as well as the season when we can travel there.</li> 
                                    <li>With pandemic , there is a significant decline in the airbnb occupancy hence decrease in listings as well. The decline is greater than -50%.</li>    
                                    </ol>
